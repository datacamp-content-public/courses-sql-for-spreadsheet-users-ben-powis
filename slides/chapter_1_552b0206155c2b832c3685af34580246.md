**How many "blue" products were sold on May 1st 2019**

- Table one: Sales {{1}}
- Table two: Products {{2}}
- Table three: Product color {{3}}

You're getting pretty great at joining tables together - good job! So far our joins have returned *all* the data in the tables we joined, but we won't always want this to be the case. Lets use the knowledge we gained earlier in the course to apply some filtering to our joined results, helping us to drill down to a more specific set of data. 

In this case: How many of the products sold on May 1st 2019 were "blue", and which catagory were these products from?

To answer this we'll once again be joining three tables: sales, products and product_color. 

'Sales' contains records of daily sales from an online store, with one row for every item purchased.

'Products' contains more detailed information on our product catalogue, such as stock, cost price and product category.

Unfortunately our business dosn't store product color data in this table, but we do have it in another table called "product_color" - luckily we are now experts at table joins, so this isn't a problem!
