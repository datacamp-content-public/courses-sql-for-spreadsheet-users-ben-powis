## Filtering joined up data

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: b5ae5724f8
```

`@part1`
Filtering our joined tables to answer a specific question.

**How many of the products sold on May 1st 2019 were "blue", and which category were these products from?  ** {{1}}

`@script`
You're getting pretty great at joining tables - good job! So far our joins have returned *all* the data in the tables, but we won't always want this to be the case. Lets use the knowledge we gained earlier in the course to apply some filtering to our results, helping us to drill down to a more specific set of data. 

In this example, we'd like to know how many of the products sold on May 1st 2019 were "blue", and which category these products belonged too.

To answer this we'll once again be joining three tables: sales, products and product_color. 

Let's remind ourselves of the table structure...

---

## A reminder of our table structure

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: e546130eb2
```

`@part1`
Our business data is stored across three tables:
- Table one: Sales ``` `biz_data.sales` ``` {{1}}
- Table two: Products  ``` `biz_data.products` ``` {{2}}
- Table three: Product color ``` `biz_data.product_color` ``` {{3}}

The common field in all three tables is the the same: `sku`. {{4}}

`@script`
'Sales' contains records of daily sales from an online store, with one row for every item purchased.

'Products' contains more detailed information on our product catalogue, such as stock, cost price and product category.

Unfortunately our business dosn't store product color data in this table, but we do have it in another table called "product_color" - luckily we are now experts at table joins, so this isn't a problem!

---

## Let's get joining!

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: f809e51e22
```

`@part1`
Join the sales table to the product table, using "sku" as the key:
``` 
SELECT * FROM `biz_data.sales` AS s
LEFT JOIN `biz_data.products` AS p ON (s.sku = p.sku)
``` {{1}}

And with product color: {{2}}
```
SELECT * FROM `biz_data.sales` AS s
LEFT JOIN `biz_data.products` AS p
ON (s.sku = p.sku)
LEFT JOIN `biz_data.product_color` AS c
ON (s.sku = c.sku)
```
 {{2}}

`@script`
Let's start by joining our tables together, so that we have all the information we need to answer this question.

First we join our sales record to our product table. *SLIDE*

This enriches our product sales records with some extra detail, so we can drill down to category...but we are still missing color - lets join that on too **SLIDE**

---

## Checking our results

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 3c496f504e
hide_title: false
```

`@part1`
![Sample data with SELECT *](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5081/datasets/929412047a17e211531f281ac61ba82371124909/Screen%20Shot%202019-06-02%20at%2019.32.55.png)

`@script`
Here is the result of joining these three tables,

we can see that our join worked as expected, but there is a lot of information here and we can't easily answer the question we want by looking at all these rows.

Let's apply some filtering!

---

## Tidying up our results

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 1599cfc778
```

`@part1`
Filter only sales for May 1st 2019:
``` WHERE date = '01-05-2019' ``` {{1}}

Show only sales of "blue products":
``` AND color = 'blue' ``` {{2}}

```
SELECT * FROM `biz_data.sales` AS s
LEFT JOIN `biz_data.products` AS p
ON (s.sku = p.sku)
LEFT JOIN `biz_data.product_color` AS c
ON (s.sku = c.sku)
WHERE date = '01-05-2019'
AND color = 'blue'
``` {{3}}

`@script`
Remember the question we are trying to answer:

How many of the products sold on May 1st 2019 
were "blue", and which category were these products from?

Let's filter our results to only get data relevant to this question.

*SLIDE*
First let's only return sales from May 1st 2019, by adding WHERE Date IS EQUAL TOO 01-05-2019.

*SLIDE*
We're also only interested in products that are "blue", so let's add a filter for these too, since this is a second filter, coming after a WHERE, we begin with AND:
AND color IS EQUAL TOO "blue".

Adding both of these filters to our join looks like this: *SLIDE*

Now that we have a much smaller, more relevant data set, let's take the final steps toward answering our question.

---

## How many blue products did we sell?

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 6cfcc5af1d
```

`@part1`
Count how many blue products we sold:
```SELECT SUM(quantity) AS blue_prods``` {{1}}

Select and group by "category":
```SELECT category
...
GROUP BY category ``` {{2}}

`@script`
So far we've been selecting all rows and columns to check the integrity of our join and filters, but we don't need to see all the rows to count how many blue product we sold - let's make SQL do the hard work for us!

We edit the SELECT statement to remove the asterix and replace it with two fields, the first bring the SUM of products sold, which in our data is only blue products.
*SLIDE*
And secondly the category of the products, so we can count how many products we sold from each group.

*SLIDE*

---

## Final query

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: d927ce091a
hide_title: true
```

`@part1`
Combining everything into a final query:
```
SELECT category, SUM(quantity) AS blue_prods,
FROM `biz_data.sales` AS s
LEFT JOIN `biz_data.products` AS p
ON (s.sku = p.sku)
LEFT JOIN `biz_data.product_color` AS c
ON (s.sku = c.sku)
WHERE date = '01-05-2019'
AND color = 'blue'
GROUP BY category
```

`@script`
We put all this together into our final SQL query, which when we run it, gives us the results...

---

## Results

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 842e3617b7
hide_title: true
```

`@part1`
Which results the results...
``` 
category   blue_prods 
hats       2
shirts     6
socks      112
shoes      1
```

Wow, our customers love blue socks!
