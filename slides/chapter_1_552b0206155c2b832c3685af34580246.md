Filtering our joined tables to answer a specific question.

**How many of the products sold on May 1st 2019 were "blue", and which category were these products from?  ** {{1}}


`@script`
You're getting pretty great at joining tables together - good job! So far our joins have returned *all* the data in the tables, but we won't always want this to be the case. Lets use the knowledge we gained earlier in the course to apply some filtering to our results, helping us to drill down to a more specific set of data. 

In this example, we'd like to know how many of the products sold on May 1st 2019 were "blue", and which category were these products from?

To answer this we'll once again be joining three tables: sales, products and product_color. 

Let's remind ourselves what is in each table...

## A reminder of our table structure

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e546130eb2"
```

`@part1`
- Table one: Sales ``` `biz_data.sales` ``` {{1}}
- Table two: Products  ``` `biz_data.products` ``` {{2}}
- Table three: Product color ``` `biz_data.product_color` ``` {{3}}


`@script`
'Sales' contains records of daily sales from an online store, with one row for every item purchased.

'Products' contains more detailed information on our product catalogue, such as stock, cost price and product category.

Unfortunately our business dosn't store product color data in this table, but we do have it in another table called "product_color" - luckily we are now experts at table joins, so this isn't a problem!

## Let's get joining!

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f809e51e22"
```

`@part1`
Join the sales table to the product table, using "sku" as the key:
``` 
SELECT * FROM `biz_data.sales` AS s
LEFT JOIN `biz_data.products` AS p ON (s.sku = p.sku)
``` {{1}}

And with product color: {{2}}
```
SELECT * FROM `biz_data.sales` AS s
LEFT JOIN `biz_data.products` AS p
ON (s.sku = p.sku)
LEFT JOIN `biz_data.product_color` AS c
ON (s.sku = c.sku)
```
 {{2}}


`@script`
Let's start by joining our tables togeather, so that we have all the information we need to answer this question.

First we join our sales record to our product table. *SLIDE*
